======
Fields
======

Fields define the behavior of the data on model's record.

Field options
=============

The following arguments are available to all field types. All are optional
except :attr:`Field.string`.

``string``
----------

.. attribute:: Field.string

A string for the label of the field.

``help``
--------

.. attribute:: Field.help

A multi-line help string for the field.

``required``
------------

.. attribute:: Field.required

If ``True``, the field is not allowed to be empty. Default is ``False``.

``readonly``
------------

.. attribute:: Field.readonly

If ``True``, the field is not editable in the client. Default is ``False``.

``domain``
----------

.. attribute:: Field.domain

A :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` constraint that will be applied on the field
value.

``states``
----------

.. attribute:: Field.states

A dictionary that defines dynamic states of the field and overrides the static
one. Possible keys are ``required``, ``readonly`` and ``invisible``.
The values are :class:`~trytond.pyson.PYSON` statements that will be evaluated
with the values of the record.

``select``
----------

.. attribute:: Field.select

If true, the content of the field will be indexed.

.. _ref-models-fields-on_change:

``on_change``
-------------

.. attribute:: Field.on_change

A set of field names. If this attribute is set, the client will call the
method ``on_change_<field name>`` of the model when the user changes the
current field value and will give the values of each fields in this list. The
method signature is::

    on_change_<field name>()

This method must change the value of the fields to be updated.

.. note::

    The on_change_<field name> methods are running in a rollbacked transaction.
..

The set of field names could be filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

.. _ref-models-fields-on_change_with:

``on_change_with``
------------------

.. attribute:: Field.on_change_with

A set of field names. Same like :attr:`on_change`, but defined the other way
around. If this attribute is set, the client will call the method
``on_change_with_<field name>`` of the model when the user changes one of the
fields defined in the list and will give the values of each fields in this
list. The method signature is::

    on_change_with_<field name>()

This method must return the new value of the field.

.. note::

    The on_change_with_<field name> methods are running in a rollbacked transaction.

..

The set of field names could be filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

``depends``
-----------

.. attribute:: Field.depends

A list of field names on which the current one depends. This means that the
client will also read these fields even if they are not defined on the view.
:attr:`Field.depends` is used per example to ensure that
:class:`~trytond.pyson.PYSON` statement could be evaluated.

``context``
-----------

.. attribute:: Field.context

A dictionary which will update the current context for *relation field*.

.. warning::
    The context could only depend on direct field of the record and without
    context.
..

``loading``
-----------

.. attribute:: Field.loading

Define how the field must be loaded: ``lazy`` or ``eager``.

``name``
--------

.. attribute:: Field.name

The name of the field.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Field.convert_domain(domain, tables, Model)

    Convert the simple :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` clause into a SQL
    expression or a new domain. :ref:`tables <ref-tables>` could be updated to
    add new joins.

.. method:: Field.sql_format(value)

    Convert the value to use as parameter of SQL queries.

.. method:: Field.sql_type()

    Return the namedtuple('SQLType', 'base type') which defines the SQL type to
    use for creation and casting.

.. method:: Field.sql_column(table)

    Return the Column instance based on table.

Default value
=============

See :ref:`default value <topics-fields_default_value>`

Searching
=========

A class method could be defined for each field which must return a SQL
expression for the given domain instead of the default one.
The method signature is::

    domain_<field name>(domain, tables)

Where ``domain`` is the simple :ref:`domain <topics-domain>` clause and
``tables`` is a nested dictionary, see :meth:`~Field.convert_domain`.

Ordering
========

A class method could be defined for each field which must return a list of SQL
expression on which to order instead of the field.
The method signature is::

    order_<field name>(tables)

Where ``tables`` is a nested dictionary, see :meth:`~Field.convert_domain`.

Depends
=======

.. method:: depends([\*fields[, methods]])

A decorator to define the field names on which the decorated method depends.
The `methods` argument can be used to duplicate the field names from other
fields. This is usefull if the decorated method calls another method.

    method ``autocomplete_<field name>`` of the model when the user changes one
    of those field value. The method signature is::

        autocomplete_<field name>()

    This method must return a list of string that will populate the

    The ``selection`` method should be an instance method.
    The set of field names could be filled by using the decorator :meth:`depends`.

.. attribute:: Selection.translate_selection

    If true, the human-readable values will be translated. Default value is
    ``True``.

Instance methods:

.. method:: Selection.translated([name])

    Returns a descriptor for the translated value of the field. The descriptor
    must be used on the same class as the field.
