Installing trytond_stock_supply_day
===================================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * trytond_purchase (http://www.tryton.org/)

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked a trytond_stock_supply_day source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name stock_supply_day.
