Installing trytond_calendar_scheduling
======================================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * trytond_calendar (http://www.tryton.org/)
 * pywebdav 0.9.8 or later (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywebdav/)
 * python-dateutil (http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the trytond_calendar_scheduling source
release, enter the directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

    python setup.py install

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name calendar_scheduling.
