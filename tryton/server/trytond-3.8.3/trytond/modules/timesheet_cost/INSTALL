Installation
------------

Once you've downloaded and unpacked the trytond_timesheet_cost source release, enter the
directory where the archive was unpacked, and run:

Note that you may need administrator/root privileges for this step, as
this command will by default attempt to install module to the Python
site-packages directory on your system.

For advanced options, please refer to the easy_install and/or the distutils
documentation:

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name timesheet_cost.
