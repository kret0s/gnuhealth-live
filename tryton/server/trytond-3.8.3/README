Database Backends
-----------------

Tryton is mainly developed for PostgreSQL (8.2 or later) but there are other 
backends available. Here are some warnings about using other backends:

  * MySQL

    * The lock implementation of MySQL requires that Tryton locks all tables.

    * There are problems with floating-point comparisons.
      See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/problems-with-float.html

    * Tryton uses a VARCHAR(255) for Char, Selection and Reference fields.

    * MySQL can not create indexes containing text or blob fields.

    * Timestamp has a precision of second which is used for optimistic lock.

    * Tryton uses a DECIMAL(65, 30) for Decimal fields and DOUBLE(255, 30) for
      Float fields.

    * MySQL version should be 5.0 or later.

  * SQLite

    * SQLite can not alter column definitions nor create foreign keys.

    * SQL constraints are validated by Tryton instead of database.

    * Timestamp has a precision of second which is used for optimistic lock.
