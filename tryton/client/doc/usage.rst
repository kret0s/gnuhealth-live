-s SERVER, --server=SERVER           Specify the server hostname

Environment
***********

`GTKOSXAPPLICATION`                  Activate with native Mac desktop

URL
***

When an url is passed, the client will try to find already running client that
could handle it and send to this one to open the url. If it doesn't find one
then it will start the GUI and open the url itself.

The url schemes are:

    `tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/model/<model name>[/<id>][;parameters]`

    `tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/wizard/<wizard name>[;parameters]`

    `tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/report/<report name>[;parameters]`


where `parameters` are the corresponding fields of actions encoded in
`JSON`_.

.. _JSON: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json
.. Note:: `model` is for `act_window`
.. Note:: `report` must have at least a data parameter with `ids`, `id` and
    `model name`


Overview

The following schematic illustration of the Tryton client shows the names of
all important visual parts.

Menu Bar
^^^^^^^^
The menu bar is the main control unit. It provides most of the functionalities
of the client application. The menu bar is grouped into categories. It is
controlled with mouse or keyboard. The `menu bar items`_ are explained later.


Mouse and Keyboard Use
++++++++++++++++++++++
Most functions of the Tryton client can be accessed with mouse or keyboard.
`Key bindings`__ for all menu items are preset. Furthermore all key bindings
are manually configurable. To change the binding of a menu item the user needs
to put the cursor onto it and simply press the user defined key combination.
For this purpose it is needed to activate the configuration of the key bindings
with Options > Menubar > Change Accelerators. After the configuration it is
preferable to disable Change Accelerators, to avoid accidental changes of key
bindings while navigating the Menu bar with the keyboard.

To remove a key binding simply press the delete button while pointing the
cursor on the menu item to change.

.. Note:: Usually key bindings are composed with modifier keys.

__ Menu-Help-Keyboard_Shortcuts_

Additionally the menu bar items are accessible with the *Alt* or *Option* key.
The user needs to hold the *Alt* or *Option* key followed by the underlined
character of the menu bar item to choose. To dive into deeper menu levels,
he needs to release the *Alt* or *Option* key and to simply press the
underlined letter of the sub menu item. If there exist several menu items with
the same shortcut, repeated activation of the shortcut key will jump to the
next one.

The second mouse button (usually right mouse button) provides an additional
contextual menu for some views and fields. In this context menu the user finds
:term:`actions` to copy and paste contents or selections for several fields.


Tabbed Main Frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This part of the client contains all the related contents and
functions provided by the :term:`Tryton server` :term:`modules`.
All aspects inside the *main frame* depend at least on the individual set
of installed modules.

The main frame provides a `tabbed document interface`__ to arrange different
views side by side. New :term:`tabs` are opened by special :term:`actions`,
like choosing a menu item or clicking some action buttons. All tabs include
titles which show the name of the provided view.

:term:`Tabs` can be arranged by Drag and Drop.

__ TDI_

.. _TDI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface

.. Note:: Inside :term:`views` there can be tabs, too.


Menu
++++
The *menu* does not contain fixed menu items.
All of them are dynamically provided by the actual set of the installed
:term:`modules` depending on the access rules of the current user. If a menu
item is clicked, the appropriate action will open in a new tab.


Home
++++
A tab opens during the startup of the Tryton client: the home.  It is
usually an item of the `Menu`_ opening when the user calls his
`Home`__ action defined in the `preferences`__.

__ Menu-User-Home_

__ Menu-User-Preferences_


Menu Bar Items
**************
The following section describes the function of each menu bar entry in detail.
A rule of thumb: All items of the menu bar that are suffixed by three dots
(...) will open an intermediate :term:`dialog` for setting up the provided
menu action. Most dialogs provide a *Cancel* button, used to stop the
complete dialog process.


File
^^^^
The file menu level provides functions about Tryton server login,
Database maintenance and closing the client application.

.. _Menu-File-Connect:

Connect...
  By choosing this menu entry the client will be connected to an available
  Tryton server. A :term:`dialog` opens to request credentials:

  * `Server`__
  * Database: Database to connect server side
  * User name: Tryton user name to login
  * Password: Tryton password to login
  * Actions:

    - Connect: Connects to the server with the given credentials.
    - Cancel

.. note:: Depending on server configuration for session timeout, the actual
   user may be logged out of the current session, and need to login again.
   Default timeout for inactivity logout is six minutes.

__ File-Server-Connection_


.. _Menu-File-Disconnect:

Disconnect...
  Disconnects the client from an active server connection. In case of unsaved
  changes in an open tab, the Tryton client will request for saving the
  changes.

Database
++++++++
This menu level provides tools to maintain Tryton databases.
For all database operations the user needs to know the Tryton server password.

.. warning:: Consider not to use this server-site maintaining functions,
             if there are security concerns. Since there are always security
             concerns in a multiuser environment, better disclaim to provide
             these functions on database level.

.. note:: Database names are restricted by some rules:

          * Allowed characters are alpha-nummeric [A-Za-z0-9] and
            underscore (_).
          * First character must be an alphabetic letter.
          * The maximum length of a database name is 64 characters.

          Tryton automatically checks if the given database name follows
          the rules.

.. _Menu-File-New_Database:

New Database
  Opens a :term:`dialog` for creating a new Tryton database with an initial
  user called *admin*.

Widgets
*******

There are a several widgets used on Tryton in client side. The follow sections
will explains some of them.


Date/DateTime/Time Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Those widgets has several key shortucts to quickly modify the value. Each key
increases if lower case or decreases if upper case:

    - `y`: by one year
    - `m`: by one month
    - `w`: by one week
    - `d`: by one day
    - `h`: by one hour
    - `i`: by one minute
    - `s`: by one second

Search Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The search widget adds the ability to easily search for records on the current
tab.  This widget is visible only on :term:`tree view`.

The Syntax
++++++++++

A query is composed of search clauses.
A clause is composed of a field name (with `:` at the end), an operator and a value.
The field name is optional and defaults to the record name.
The operator is also optional and defaults to `like` or `equal` depending on
the type of the field.  The default operator is `=` except for fields of type
`char`, `text` and `many2one` which is `ilike`.

Field Names
+++++++++++

All field names shown in the :term:`tree view` can be searched. Field names
must be followed by a `:`

    For example: ``Name:``

If the field name contains spaces, it is possible to
escape it using double quotes.

    For example: ``"Receivable Today":``

Operators
+++++++++

The following operators can be used:

    * `=`: equal to
    * `<`: less then
    * `<=`: less then or equal to
    * `>`: greater then
    * `>=`: greater then or equal to
    * `!=`: not equal
    * `!`: not equal or not like (depending of the type of field)

    For example: ``Name: != Dwight``

.. note:: The `ilike` operator is never explicit and `%` is appended to the
    value to make it behaves like `starts with`

Values
++++++

The format of the value depends on the type of the field.
A list of values can be set using `;` as separator.

    For example: ``Name: Michael; Pam``

    It will find all records having the `Name` starting with `Michael` or
    `Pam`.

A range of number values can be set using `..`.

    For example: ``Amount: 100..500``

    It will find all records with `Amount` between `100` and `500` included.

There are two wildcards:

    * `%`: matches any string of zero or more characters.
    * `_`: matches any single character.

It is possible to escape special characters in values by using double quotes.

    For example: ``Name: "Michael:Scott"``

    Here it will search with the value `Michael:Scott`.

Clause composition
++++++++++++++++++

The clauses can be composed using the two boolean operators `and` and `or`.
By default, there is an implicit `and` between each clause if no operator is
specified.

    For example: ``Name: Michael Amount: 100``

    is the same as ``Name: Michael and Amount: 100``

The `and` operator has a highest precedence than `or` but you can change it by
using parenthesis.

    For example: ``(Name: Michael or Name: Pam) and Amount: 100``

    is different than ``Name: Michael or Name: Pam and Amount: 100``

    which is evaluated as ``Name: Michael or (Name: Pam and Amount: 100)``
